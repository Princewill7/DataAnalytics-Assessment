# DataAnalytics-Assessment
## Assessment 1 - Approach
I approached the task with CTEs. CTEs break down complex queries into simple logical steps that improve readability, performance, and maintenance. Question 1 was one of many instances in data analytics where complex calculations needed to be made, which allowed me to call on those queries with the filter function and complete the task.

## Assessment 1 - Challenges
Two challenges were encountered;
1. It was difficult to differentiate between a savings plan and a fixed investment plan.
2. After identifying the fixed investment plan, it was noticed that the maturity start and end dates were the same.

## Assessment 2 - Approach
A CTE-based approach was used again. The task was to find the frequency and to split all transactions into frequencies where the frequencies had the parameters of looking at all transactions done once. The time functions were broken down with CTE since the frequency time was months. After which, another CTE was used to reference the first time function breakdown and the split into frequency. Then both CTEs were called with a grand calculation that merges everything together. 

## Assessment 2 - challenges
Because task 1 demanded a good understanding of the data mappings of the table, tackling task 2 required the same thing; hence, the same strategy was applied.

## Assessment 3 - Approach
